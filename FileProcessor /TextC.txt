There are several possible ideas for an algorithm that deletes items from the list as
they are encountered. Of course, one idea is to construct a new list containing all the odd
numbers, and then clear the original list and copy the odd numbers back into it. But we are
more interested in writing a clean version that avoids making a copy and instead removes
items from the list as they are encountered.
